# ConverterMPS
MPS project where a user can enter either binary, decimal or hexadecimal values and do calculations with these values.
Types of calculations are: sum, subtraction and multiplication. 
The program gets all the entered values, converts them into decimal values and then does the chosen calculations to all of values.
Which means it sums/subtracts/multiplies all of the values.
